# 🏳️‍🌈 ColourStream: A Self Hosted Suite of Open Source Tools for Colourists


## 🚀 Overview

ColourStream has evolved into a comprehensive suite of open source tools designed to assist the everyday colorist with their workflows. By being self-hosted, ColourStream won't succumb to "enshittification" - the common degradation of platforms as they prioritize profit whislt actively making the user experience worse.

Powered by OvenMediaEngine and Mirotalk (AGPL), ColourStream provides potential end-to-end latency of less than 5 frames, making it perfect for real-time collaboration and client reviews.

ColourStream Uploader streamlines file transfers by eliminating the need for multiple transfer applications. The workflow is simple: create a client profile, set up a project, and generate a secure, time-limited upload link. This unique hashed link allows clients to easily and safely transfer files directly to your system. 

We reccomend our sister application "TurboSort https://github.com/chaos-dotcom/TurboSort" which works in tandem to link Colourstream Uploaders File Structure with your existing Project File Structure

💡 **Built by A Colourist, for Colorists** - with features specifically designed for the unique needs of colour grading professionals. Unlike grading over Zoom, Teams or another video meeting app, ColourStream is a purpose-built application designed from the ground up with colour grading in mind, leveraging OvenMediaEngine to ensure a fully accurate Colour Pipeline Workflow

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧩 Components

- **Frontend**: React-based SPA for user interaction and stream viewing
- **Backend**: Node.js API with Prisma ORM for business logic
- **OvenMediaEngine**: Handles video streaming (SRT, RTMP, WebRTC)
- **Mirotalk**: Provides WebRTC-based video conferencing
- **Upload Portal**: Secure file sharing portal for client uploads and downloads
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage for file uploads and storage
- **Traefik**: Manages routing, SSL termination, and load balancing
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores user data, room configurations, and system settings
- **TurboSort**: Optional tool for linking uploaded files to existing project structure
- **User Filesystem**: Local storage where media files are ultimately accessed for grading work

## 📤 Upload Portal

ColourStream includes a dedicated upload portal that allows clients to securely share large media files with colorists:

- **🔗 Shareable Links**: Generate time-limited upload links to share with clients
- **📂 Project Organization**: Organize uploads by client and project for easy management
- **↪️ Resumable Uploads**: TUS protocol support for reliable, resumable uploads of large files
- **🔒 Secure Access**: Token-based authentication for client uploads without full system access
- **⬇️ Easy Downloads**: Download completed files directly through the interface
- **📐 User-Friendly UI**: Modern interface with drag-and-drop support and progress monitoring

The upload portal is ideal for receiving high-resolution media files from clients while maintaining organization and security. It eliminates the need for external file sharing services, keeping your workflow self-contained within the ColourStream ecosystem.

For detailed information about the upload portal setup, see [Upload Portal Documentation](docs/upload-portal.md).

## 🔒 Authentication

ColourStream uses a modern, secure authentication system that prioritizes passkey (WebAuthn) authentication:
- 🔑 Passwordless authentication using device biometrics
- 🔄 Automatic transition from password to passkey authentication
- 🛡️ Enhanced security with WebAuthn standard
- 🎟️ JWT-based authentication for secure service-to-service communication
- 🔑 ColourStream also Supports Single Sign On via OIDC

For detailed information about the authentication system, see [Authentication Documentation](docs/authentication.md).
For information about JWT key naming conventions, see [JWT Keys Documentation](docs/jwt_keys.md).

## 🖥️ Streaming Architecture

### OvenMediaEngine Configuration

ColourStream leverages OvenMediaEngine's powerful streaming capabilities:

#### Origin Server
- Primary streaming ingest point
- Supports RTMP, SRT, and WebRTC inputs
- Handles transcoding and adaptive bitrate streaming
- Distributes to edge servers for scalability

#### Optional Edge Server can be setup to, although all functionality can be done by the Origin Server if needed. 

- Distributes streams to viewers
- Supports WebRTC and LLHLS playback
- Optimized for low-latency delivery


### Video Conferencing

Mirotalk provides real-time video communication:
- WebRTC-based peer-to-peer conferencing
- Integrated with the streaming platform for seamless reviews
- Accessible via `video.colourstream.[domain]`

## 🌐 Networking

All containers communicate through the `colourstream_network` Docker network:
- Traefik handles external access to web applications
- OvenMediaEngine exposes specific ports for streaming protocols
- Internal services communicate securely within the Docker network

## 🔐 Security

### SSL/TLS Certificates

The system uses Traefik's Built in ACME for SSL/TLS certificates with automatic renewal:
- Certificate resolver: letsencrypt
- Challenge type: HTTP
- Certificate storage: ./traefik/acme.json

### Secret Detection

This repository uses [Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) to detect and prevent hardcoded secrets in the codebase.

For more security information, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

DNS Setup
We suggest setting an A record for *.colourstream to point to your server's public IP address.
rather than setting separate records for each subdomain.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chaos-dotcom/colourstream.git
cd colourstream

# Setup firewall rules
cd setup
# This will make the setup scripts executable
chmod +x ./setup/*.sh
# This will setup the ufw rules for the server.
./setup_ufw_rules.sh
cd ..

# Run the setup 

chmod +x ./setup-ghcr.sh
./setup-ghcr.sh

# Start the to spawn certs
docker compose up -d 

## Please note that you may need to quit out of this docker compose command using ctrl+c and then move to the next step.

# Setup certificate renewal
cd setup
./renew_certificates.sh

# restart all services
cd ..
docker compose up -d



```

That's it! Access your ColourStream installation at:
- Main app: `https://live.colourstream.yourdomain.com`
- Video conferencing: `https://video.colourstream.yourdomain.com`
- Upload portal: `https://upload.colourstream.yourdomain.com`
- the admin dashboard is accessible at live.colourstream.yourdomain.com/admin/login
    - you will need to register a passkey to login to the admin dashboard, if you click the login button you will be taken to a one time setup page where you will be able to register a passkey.
### Basic Requirements

=
### Common Commands

```bash
# View all container logs
docker-compose logs

# View logs for a specific service
docker-compose logs [service-name]

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild and restart services
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## 🛡️ Self-Hosted Advantage

ColourStream is designed to be fully self-hosted, providing several key advantages:

- **🚫 No Enshittification**: Avoid the common problem of platforms degrading quality or introducing unwanted changes to maximize profit
- **👑 Complete Control**: You own and control your entire workflow and data
- **🔏 Data Privacy**: Client media stays on your systems, not on third-party servers
- **🔄 Customizability**: Modify and adapt the platform to your specific workflow needs
- **💰 No Subscription Fees**: Pay only for your hosting costs, not per-user or feature fees
- **🔒 Independence**: Your tools won't disappear due to company shutdowns, acquisitions, or policy changes

By self-hosting ColourStream, colorists maintain control over their professional tools and workflows, ensuring they remain stable, private, and tailored to actual needs rather than corporate profit motives.

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options, refer to Docker Compose files and environment templates:
- `docker-compose.yml`: Main service configuration
- `global.env.template`: Global environment variables
- `backend/.env.template`: Backend-specific configuration
- `frontend/.env`: Frontend configuration
- `coturn/turnserver.conf.template`: TURN server configuration template

### TURN Server Configuration
To set up the TURN server:
1. Copy `coturn/turnserver.conf.template` to `coturn/turnserver.conf`
2. Replace `your_turn_credential_here` with a secure credential
3. Update the domain name in `realm` and certificate paths
4. The actual `turnserver.conf` is gitignored for security
